# Scaler
Python GUI program to find scales on the strings instruments on diffrent tunnings

To be completely honest â€” this program is not finished yet. You can see a lot of error messages in the console, and the interface is unbelievably ugly, but it works.
I'll fix everything as soon as possible, but if this program already could help you in creating music - I'll be extremely happy.
